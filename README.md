A replacement for the Lagoon storage-calculator service that runs in remote clusters

Individual namespaces can have the following labels to change the behaviour of storage calculator

* `lagoon.sh/storageCalculatorEnabled` if set to false, will exclude it from having its volumes calculated
* `lagoon.sh/storageCalculatorIgnoreRegex` this will override the default regex (if one is set)

Storage-calculator pods created by this controller get a label of `lagoon.sh/storageCalculator=true`

Storage-calculator connects to rabbitmq in lagoon-core and publishes to the actions-handler `lagoon-actions` exchange for the actions-handler in core to process.
